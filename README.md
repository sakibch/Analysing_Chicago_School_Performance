# Analysing_Chicago_School_Performance

In this notebook we work with a real world dataset using SQL and Python. We will:
1. Understand the dataset for Chicago Public School level performance
2. Store the dataset in an Db2 database on IBM Cloud instance
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns and query data from mixed case columns
4. Solve example problems to practice SQL skills including using built-in database functions

**DATASET**:The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.
